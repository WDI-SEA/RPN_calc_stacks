Calculation Functions
    At first I tried creating a library that returned the correct calculations.
    However, it kept breaking and I eventually realized why:
        Since the calculation was defined in the library, it was evaluating each even of them upon creation.
        It broke on test 5 because it calculated 12 ** 381 which overflowed, even though it wasn't getting returned.
    I tried using the Math module, but it didn't have functions for the simpler calculations.
        Instead of using math for some and not others, I decided to keep it uniform and created functions for each.
        I kept the dictionary, but moved it into the main function and had it reference my calculation function instead.
    I'm not sure if it's the driest, but it is the most scalable.
        I can use this system to build any 2 argument operation that doesn't inherently break python
